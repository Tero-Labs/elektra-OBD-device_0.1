This software was written by Alexander Peslyak in 2001.  No copyright is
claimed, and the software is hereby placed in the public domain.
In case this attempt to disclaim copyright and place the software in the
public domain is deemed null and void, then the software is
Copyright (c) 2001 Alexander Peslyak and it is hereby released to the
general public under the following terms:

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted.

There's ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, express or implied.

(This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)

This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
the properties of the two independent implementations.

The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
compile-time configuration.

4. Confidentiality.
(a) Licensee agrees that the Software (including but not limited to the Source Code, Object Code and library
files) and its derivatives, Documentation and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and ideas relating to the
Software and the Documentation are proprietary information belonging to Microchip and its licensors (“Proprietary
Information”). Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or
disclose any Proprietary Information and will similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing. Proprietary
Information will not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and
through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the
receiving party can demonstrate was developed by the receiving party independently and without use of or reference to the
disclosing party's Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on
disclosure. If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, such
disclosure will not be deemed a breach of this Agreement provided that Licensee: (x) gives Microchip prompt notice of
such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or limit such disclosure; (y) cooperates with Microchip to protect
Proprietary Information; and (z) Licensee complies with any protective order in place and discloses only the information
required by process of law.
(b) Licensee agrees that the provisions of this Agreement regarding unauthorized use and nondisclosure of
the Software, Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of
Microchip and its licensors and that monetary damages alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its licensors if
such provisions are violated. Licensee, therefore, agrees that if Microchip alleges that Licensee or Third Party has breached
or violated such provision then Microchip will have the right to petition for injunctive relief, without the requirement for
the posting of a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.
5. Ownership of Proprietary Rights.

including all hardware and software implementations of the Software technology (expressly excluding Licensee and Third
Party code developed and used in conformance with this Agreement solely to interface with the Software and Licensee
Products and/or Third Party Products); and (iii) all copies and derivative works thereof (by whomever produced). Further,
copies and derivative works will be considered works made for hire with ownership vesting in Microchip on creation. To
the extent such modifications and derivatives do not qualify as a “work for hire,” Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers,
assigns and conveys the exclusive copyright thereof to Microchip, free and clear of any and all liens, claims or other
encumbrances, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is
limited to the license rights described in Sections 1 and 2 above.
(b) Licensee will have no right to sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the Software,
Documentation, or any related intellectual property rights except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
6. Termination of Agreement. Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement terminates immediately,
without notice by Microchip, upon a failure by Licensee or Third Party to comply with any provision of this Agreement.
Further, Microchip may also terminate this Agreement upon reasonable belief that Licensee or Third Party failed to comply
with this Agreement. Upon termination, Licensee and Third Party will immediately stop using the Software,
Documentation, and derivatives thereof, and immediately destroy all such copies.

part of this Agreement.

AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT
